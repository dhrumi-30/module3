*What is List? How will you reverse a list?
=>a list is a collection of items or elements that are stored in a particular order.
=>To reverse a list in Python, you can use the built-in reverse() method or slice notation. 

*How will you remove last object from a list?
=>To remove the last object from a list in Python, you can use the pop() method with no argument or you can use slice notation.
*Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?
list1 [-1] is 25.

*Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?
=>The append() method is used to add a single element to the end of the list.
=>The extend() method, on the other hand, is used to append multiple elements to the end of a list.

*How will you compare two lists?
=>To compare two lists in Python, you can use the == operator.

*How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?
=>In Python, you can create a dictionary using tuples by passing a list of tuples to the dict() 
constructor or by using dictionary comprehension.


*How Do You Traverse Through A Dictionary Object In Python?
=>In Python, you can traverse through a dictionary object using loops such as for loop.

*How Do You Check The Presence Of A Key In A Dictionary?
=>In Python, you can check the presence of a key in a dictionary using the in keyword or the get() method.

*Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
=>The zip() method in Python is used to combine multiple sequences (e.g., lists, tuples) into a single sequence of tuples.

*How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?
=>In Python, there are two basic types of functions:
1)Built-in functions: 
2)User-defined functions

*How can you pick a random item from a list or tuple?
=>In Python, you can use the random module to pick a random item from a list or tuple.

*How can you pick a random item from a range?
=>In Python, you can use the random module to pick a random item from a range.

*How can you get a random number in python?
In Python, you can use the random module to generate random numbers.

*How will you set the starting value in generating random numbers?
=>in Python, you can set the starting value for generating random numbers using the random.seed() function.

*How will you randomizes the items of a list in place?
=>In Python, you can randomize the items of a list in place using the random.shuffle() function
